# DBMS_technology
This project aims to explore different techniques used while implementing a DBMS.
There are three techniques that are explored in this project: storage media, external memory sorting, and join. All three parts of the project are tested on the "Arizona State University Twitter Data Set" (link: http://academictorrents.com/details/2399616d26eeb4ae9ac3d05c7fdd98958299efa9).

Part 1 of the project investigates the data access characteristics of primary and secondary storage devices. It explores the speed of data transfer between main memory and disks, and performance differences for sequential and random I/Os.

Part 2 explores the performance of the 2PMMS algorithm with relation to buffer size.

Part 3 explores different joining algorithms used in a DBMS. Specifically we looked at two join queries:
1.Producing the list and the count of user ID pairs which follows one another.
2.Producing the list of top 10 "celebrities", sorted by (in-degree - out-degree)-difference in descending order (from more famous to less famous).

The final reports to this project is located in the root directory of this repo. The starter code to this project is provided in https://github.com/mgbarsky/csc443_winter_2017.
